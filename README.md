internal class TicketCounter
{
    public static void CounterA() => Console.WriteLine("Person A is collecting ticket from Counter A");
    public static void CounterB() => Console.WriteLine("Person B is collecting ticket from Counter B");
    public static void CounterC() => Console.WriteLine("Person C is collecting ticket from Counter C");
}
```
